# InternalStellarStructure
This is a code to determine the stellar structure of stars with mass > 1.3 solar masses. Final project of AS.171.611.01 "Stellar Structure and Evolution subject" at the Johns Hopkins University.

## This code can be applied to solve stars with a mass between 1.3 - 10 $M_{\odot}$ and also assuming fully ionized and the chemical composition of the Sun 

To execute this code only need to edit the file: mainstellarcode.py and modify:

The initial mass $> 1.3 M_{\odot}$

*as a suggestion to leave running in multiprocess with 4 CPUs, but If you want to change this option can modify it in the arguments (args) the two last values by False and 1 

In this PDF you can observe some physical assumptions, implementations, and analysis of the results
